## About Me

---

**My journey into the world of Data Science began in high school**, when I took my first programming class. I was instantly drawn to the logical thinking and problem-solving involved in coding. At the same time, I found myself interested in visual storytelling and design, which sparked my curiosity in data visualization and communication.

Over time, I realized I didn’t have to choose between analytical thinking and creativity—I could combine them. That realization led me to pursue a Master’s in **Data Science at SASTRA University**, where I explore the intersection of data, technology, and design.

It’s the perfect path for someone like me who loves turning complex data into clear, compelling insights.
